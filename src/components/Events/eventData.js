The landscape truly was not prepared for what DeGods would bring. During this time, the team was created and the planning phase began.",

      'With its first announcements released on Twitter and Discord, Frank and the Degods Core Team opened the gates of Solympus to the DeGods community anxious to enter. One announcement in particular, the Paper Hand Bitch Tax (PHBT) sparked a chain-wide discussion and inspired projects across Solana to react and respond to this contreversial idea - a 33.3% tax on paper hands that sold below a specified floor price. The team had established themselves and the community as "habitual line-steppers" (RIP Charlie Murphy) prepared to question the status quo at every turn.',

      "The team continued to defy norms by requiring members of the early community to complete \"bounties\" that would gain them presale access and, in rare cases, airdrops. This was in huge contrast to most projects that encouraged their members to spam invites all over the internet to gain early access to whitelists and presales. Brilliantly, this move worked in everyone's favor, as twitter became a hub for creative expression and memorable antics. And to top it all off, it was all really powerful marketing. At this time, @aussienftguy (at the time, @kykerkow) was recognized for the first of many times for his dedication to the bounties and won the bounty airdrop. If you don't know Aussie, where the hell have you been?",

      'On the day of the first presale, the team ran into multiple issues with their NFT generator (Candy Machine by Metaplex), which caused Frank to have to announce a 12-hour delay. This moved the mint to 9PM PST / 12AM EST, leaving some people in Europe to stay up well into the morning! Like any good Solana mint, there was FUD, some tears, and a lot of mean things said about Frank\'s mom. This was also the genesis of the now-infamous "Frank is typing..." meme that we often see in the DeGods circle, as Frank slowly typed out (with what I can only infer was a combination of dread and panic) the news of the moment. The mint was continuously pushed past 9PM PST until the doors opened suddenly with many (including the authors of this webpage) asleep at their computers. The dedication so many had to being a part of this experiment speaks volumes to the belief in what they were trying to achieve.',

      "In order to generate some hype and show the crypto space what DeGods is all about, Frank revealed a video showing their burn process manually - something that would soon become automated (and a staple of the brand). The video shows a DeGod being sold under the floor price and being sent to the burn wallet (note the address: 1nc1nerator11111...). The real note here was that 33.3% of the sale price went straight to the DeGods wallet, funding the burn bot to remove more floor DeGods from the supply. This was the core tenet of their experiment with deflationary NFTs!",

All this hype and positive press right ahead of public mint caused DeGods to land at #22 trending on Twitter (!!) and gave DeGods a huge name to live up to.",

All the while, scammers, bots, and FUD plagued the internet in a cosmic battle of good and evil. The mint site was announced ahead of time, with the password being dropped right at 3PM PST. Unfortunately, the DeGods Discord was attacked with bots right before launch, so an executive decision was made to only release the password on Twitter. The problem was: this change was announced on Discord at a time where bots were causing chaos, and many people didn't see the message in time. With the public mint selling out in moments, this left many people full of FUD, calling the project a rug, thowing spirits to an all time low.",

As things inevitably got delayed, the team decided that they would be sending SOL to random holders every hour until the site went live. All the while, fake DeGods NFTs were being sold to those of us with half a brain, and then those same people tried flipping them, getting hit with the PHBT and filling up the Incinerator wallet with fakes.
